We hope that this will prove useful to the C++ community and help guide us as we work on the next version of our proposal for the C++ Standardization meeting to be held in Bristol (April 2013). \r\n\r\n### The current version (12/2012) implements subproposals 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5.\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Allow the type-specifier within a parameter declaration of a lambda to be auto (i.e. auto is mandatory)\r\n    \r\n    auto Sum = [](auto a, decltype(a) b) { return a + b; };\r\n    int i = Sum(3, 4);\r\n    double d = Sum(3.14, 2.77);\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Allow the use of familiar template syntax in lambda expressions\r\n    auto NumElements = []<int N>(auto (&a)[N]) { return N; }; \r\n    int arri[]{1, 2, 3};\r\n    double arrd[]{3.14, 2.77, 6.626};\r\n    auto total = NumElements(arri) + NumElements(arrd);\r\n\r\n### 2.3 Permit a lambda body to be an expression\r\n\r\n    int local = 10;\r\n    auto L = [&](auto a) a + ++local;\r\n\r\n### 2.4 Named Lambda Syntax has NOT been implemented yet\r\n\r\n### 2.5 Autogenerate a conversion to function pointer in captureless generic lambdas\r\n    auto L = [](auto a, decltype(a) b) { return a + b; };\r\n    int (*fp)(int, int) = L;\r\n\r\n### I also used Richard Smith's (@zygoloid) return type deduction patch to allow the following\r\n\r\n    int local = 10;\r\n    auto L = [](auto &a) -> auto& { return a; };\r\n    ++L(local); \r\n\r\n### How to Compile the Code \r\n\r\n1. Download the appropriate version of llvm (167560) by following the instructions at : http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html.  I use TortoiseSVN on windows, and if you do, be sure to download the correct version of llvm (167560)\r\n2. All the development has been done using Visual Studio 2010 - I have not compiled this using xcode or gcc, if anyone could help me with this, I would certainly appreciate it.\r\n3. In the above instructions from the clang website, where it states to checkout clang using subversion (i.e step 3 svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang), instead install git (I use TortoiseGit on windows) and checkout this repository.\r\n4. Then follow the instructions as delineated on clangs website to compile and build clang.\r\n5. Once you have your clang binary, it should be able to compile your code and generate the executable that should run directly.  On windows, I find myself having to use the interpreter lli.exe.  So I do the following when trying to compile code in test.cpp:\r\n<pre>\r\n    clang -std=c++1y -c test.cpp -emit-llvm -o test.bc\r\n    lli test.bc\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n### How to use the binaries:\r\n1. I have uploaded my most recent Debug build of generic-lambda-clang that was built using visual studio 2010 and lli.exe.\r\n2. In order for you to use it, you need certain debug dlls that I can not legally post here - An easy way is probably for you to install [Visual C++ 2010 Express (free)](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-express-windows-desktop).\r\n3. Download the windows exectutable [generic-lambda-clang.exe](https://www.sugarsync.com/pf/D6969703_69613999_6754006) along with the [llvm interpreter: lli.exe](https://www.sugarsync.com/pf/D6969703_65299173_039062) if you need it.\r\n<pre>\r\n    generic-lambda-clang -std=c++1y -c test.cpp -emit-llvm -o test.bc\r\n    lli test.bc\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":""}
